# ruview-python Memory

## Context Card

Status: scaffolded
Domain: phd
Tags: phd, research, ruview, wifi-densepose, python, csi, signal-processing
Project path: /Users/sushrutpatwardhan/1Projects/ruview-python
Main brain workstream: /Users/sushrutpatwardhan/sushrut/wiki/workstreams/ruview-python/index.md
Devices/servers: sushruts-macbook-pro
Latest useful result: Milestone 0 scaffold is present, Milestone 1 has an initial tested core-contract port, and the development environment is now managed by `uv` with `uv.lock`.
Current blocker: ESP32 protocol parser work has not started; Milestone 2 source mappings and binary packet fixtures still need to be selected.
Next action: Start Milestone 2 with host-side ESP32 packet formats (`0xC511_0001`, `0xC511_0002`, `0xC511_0004`, `0xC511_A110`) and add parser parity tests.

## Active Threads

- Build a readable, experiment-friendly Python research port of RuView / WiFi-DensePose from `/Users/sushrutpatwardhan/1Projects/RuView`.
- Port by capability boundary rather than line-by-line translation.
- Preserve data contracts and wire formats where they matter, with fixtures, tests, and notebooks for inspection.

## Recent Work

- 2026-05-31: Initialized project memory from the knowledge base and linked it to the main workstream.
- 2026-05-31: Captured the current repo state as not a Git repository with `plan.md` as the only discovered project file.
- 2026-05-31: Created the Python package scaffold, first core data contracts, synthetic notebook placeholders, examples, and tests. Verified with `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` (`9 passed`) and a synthetic empty-vs-present example.
- 2026-05-31: Replaced the pip-created `.venv` with a `uv`-managed environment via `uv sync --extra dev`; verified with `uv run pytest -q` (`9 passed`).
- 2026-05-31: Expanded `README.md` with project goals, layout, `uv` quick check, and explicit acknowledgement of upstream `ruvnet/RuView` and its MIT license notice.
- 2026-05-31: User initialized Git; expanded `.gitignore` for Python, `uv`, notebook, editor, and local recording artifacts; verified with `uv run pytest -q` before first commit.
